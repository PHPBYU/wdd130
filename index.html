        <p>Cambodia is a Southeast Asian country known for its rich history, ancient temples, and vibrant culture. It is home to the iconic Angkor Wat, the largest religious monument in the world, reflecting the grandeur of the Khmer Empire. The capital, Phnom Penh, blends colonial architecture with modern development. Cambodia's history includes the tragic Khmer Rouge era, but the nation has since made significant strides in recovery and growth. With lush landscapes, a thriving arts scene, and warm hospitality, Cambodia remains a fascinating destination for travelers and historians alike.</p>
